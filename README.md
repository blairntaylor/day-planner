In this homework assignment, we created a daily calendar that shows the current date time at the top using a section of moment code that is dropped into the end of the javascript document.

The main content of the calendar is an HTML grid of rows and columns. The green area is a text are and then the blue tab along the side is where the text is saved into the local storage.

As time passes the green blocks of text area will change color depending on if they are past, present, or future. The user can click into the text block and save an event using the blue save button.

The challenges wre keeping the classes in order and, making sure than all of them had the correct classes. I had wanted to add a clear button for the user but am still working on that.
